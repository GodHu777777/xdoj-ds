It's been a long time since using dp(dynamic programing),I think it's interesting generally but sometimes hard to find a better solution,the key is to find when the _state transformation_ will happen.

Today's problem(3_P257) is to find LCS(longest common substring),the state transformation happens just when the 2 letters in both strings equal,I think I've almost completed but I wa in some test case,I will solve it later.

BTW, mid-term exam is coming, I have little time on algorithm problems,(maybe only 1 hour per day).TT
